### Machine Learning Problem Statement: Income Prediction using Logistic Regression

### Objective:
    Develop a machine learning model to analyze a dataset and predict whether an individual's income is above or below $50,000 based on various demographic and socio-economic features. The model should utilize logistic regression and explore the suitability of different types of regression for this classification task.

### Dataset:
    The dataset contains the following parameters:

    AGE
    WORKCLASS
    FNLWGT
    EDUCATION
    EDUCATIONNUM
    MARITALSTATUS
    OCCUPATION
    RELATIONSHIP
    RACE
    SEX
    CAPITALGAIN
    CAPITALLOSS
    HOURSPERWEEK
    NATIVECOUNTRY
    ABOVE50K (Target variable)

### Tasks:

### Data Exploration:

    Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features.
    Visualize the relationships between different features.
    Analyze the distribution of the target variable (ABOVE50K).
### Data Preprocessing:

    Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.
    Convert categorical variables like WORKCLASS, EDUCATION, MARITALSTATUS, OCCUPATION, RELATIONSHIP, RACE, SEX, and NATIVECOUNTRY into a format suitable for logistic regression (e.g., one-hot encoding).
### Feature Selection:

  Choose relevant features for predicting whether an individual's income is above or below $50,000.
### Logistic Regression:

  Implement a logistic regression model to predict the binary outcome of the ABOVE50K variable.
  Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

### Evaluation Metrics:

  Utilize appropriate metrics for evaluating classification models, considering the nature of the task.
### Result Analysis:

    Analyze the model's predictions to understand how well it generalizes to new data.
    Interpret the coefficients and their significance in the logistic regression model.
### Deployment (Optional):

    If applicable, deploy the trained logistic regression model for making predictions on new data.
