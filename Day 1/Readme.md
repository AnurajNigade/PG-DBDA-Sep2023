# Machine Learning Roadmap:
-------------------------
    Step 1: Fundamental Theories
    Step 2: Machine Learning Algorithms
    Step 3: Implementation of ML algorithms using Libraries
    step 4: Building the project

# Learning: 
---------
	-The acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or by being taught.
	
	-Machine Learning term was introduced by Athur Samuel in 1959.
	-develop system that can automatically adapt and customize themselves.
	-discover the new knowledge from large databases.
	-develop systems that are too difficult/expensive to construct manually.
	
# Machine Learning: 
-----------------
	-Algorithms : build the model
	-Data : nothing but your experience (backbone)
	-Computing : gives you automation (Computing power)
	
# Domain in ML:
-------------
	-Applied Maths
	-Statistics
	-Computer Science
	-Psychology
	
# Working of Machine Learning:
-----------------------------
	
	Input data ---> Analyze---->Find patterns ---> Predictions -----> Feedback
	
# Types of Learning:
-------------------
### Supervised Learning:
	=====================
		-Train an algorithm on a labelled dataset (training data) to predict the correct output value
			for unseen inputs (testing data)
			
		-Input/Output
		-Labelled data
		-Classification & Regression
			
### Unsupervised Learning:
	=======================
		-Train an algorithm to find similarities on abnormalities in the data set.
		
		-Input
		-Unlabelled data
		-Clustering

### Reinforncement Learning:
	==========================
		-Learn through trial and error basis from interaction with an environment.
		-States and action
		-No dataset required
		-Decision making
