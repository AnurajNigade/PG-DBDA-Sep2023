## Problem Statement: Income Prediction using Regression and Classification Techniques

### Machine Learning Problem Statement: Income Prediction using Regression and Classification Techniques

### Objective:
    Develop a machine learning model to analyze a dataset and predict an individual's income based on various demographic and socio-economic features. The task involves using both regression and classification techniques to predict the continuous income amount and classify individuals into income categories, such as above or below a certain threshold.

### Dataset:
    The dataset contains the following parameters:
    
    AGE
    WORKCLASS
    FNLWGT
    EDUCATION
    EDUCATIONNUM
    MARITALSTATUS
    OCCUPATION
    RELATIONSHIP
    RACE
    SEX
    CAPITALGAIN
    CAPITALLOSS
    HOURSPERWEEK
    NATIVECOUNTRY
    SALARY (Target variable)

### Tasks:

### Data Exploration:

    Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features.
    Visualize the relationships between different features.
    Analyze the distribution of the target variable (SALARY).
### Data Preprocessing:

    Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.
    Convert categorical variables like WORKCLASS, EDUCATION, MARITALSTATUS, OCCUPATION, RELATIONSHIP, RACE, SEX, and NATIVECOUNTRY into a format suitable for both regression and classification (e.g., one-hot encoding for classification).
### Regression Technique:

    Implement a regression model to predict the continuous income amount.
    Evaluate the regression model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error).
### Classification Technique:

    Implement a classification model to classify individuals into income categories (e.g., above or below a certain threshold).
    Evaluate the classification model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
### Ensemble Techniques (Optional):

    Explore ensemble techniques, such as random forests or gradient boosting, to improve the overall predictive performance.
### Hyperparameter Tuning:

    Optimize hyperparameters for both the regression and classification models to improve their performance.
### Result Analysis:

    Analyze the predictions of both models to understand how well they generalize to new data.
    Interpret the coefficients and their significance in the regression model.
### Deployment (Optional):

    If applicable, deploy the trained models for making predictions on new data.
### Monitoring and Updating (Optional):

    If deployed, establish a system for monitoring the models' performance over time.
    Plan for model updates or retraining based on new data.
